phUML is a fully automatic [UML][uml] class diagram generator written in [PHP](https://php.net/).
It creates a class diagram from an Object-Oriented codebase based on the UML specification.

To successfully create UML diagrams with phUML you will need to install the [graphviz][graphviz] toolkit.

phUML will use either `neato` or `dot` commands to create class diagrams.

## How does it look like?

The image shown here, is the class diagram generated by phUML when it's executed against its [original codebase][codebase].
This image is hardly readable, because it has been resized to fit in the layout of this page.
