phUML is a fully automatic [UML][uml] class diagram generator written in [PHP](https://php.net/).
It creates a class diagram from an Object-Oriented codebase based on the UML specification.

## Installation

## Phive

phUML can be installed by [Phive](https://phar.io/) - The PHAR Installation and Verification Environment.

```
phive install phuml
```

Phive will generate a `.phive` and a `tools` directory which you may want to add to your `.gitignore` file.

### Docker

You can replace `5.2.0` with any of the available [tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/montealegreluis/phuml/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated)

## Composer

phUML can be installed globally by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
